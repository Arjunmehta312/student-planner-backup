## What is AI?


Term coined by John McCarthy (American Computer Scientist) 


**Artificial Intelligence is the ability of a computer to act like a human being**


It is a method of making a computer/controlled-robot/software think intelligently like the human mind.


The **principle** here is “Human intelligence can be defined in a way that a machine can mimic and execute.”
