## AI in cybersecurity


---


### Enhanced threat detection


Analyze vast amounts of data quickly and identify a threat
Example: AI powered SIEM SECUIRUTY AND EVEENT MANAGEMENT detects unusual login from employee account at odd hours with unrecognized IP


### Improved response time


Automate responses reducing time between detection and mitigation
Example: AI Driven SOAR Platform to identify suspicious outbound traffic


### Proactive defense


Using AI predictive analysis
Example: AI powered integrated using Azure Sentinel and Microsoft defender for Endpoint


### Handling complexity


Increasing complex and involve multiple attack vectors


### Reducing workload for security teams


Automatic log checking


### Scalability


Handle large volumes of data and increasing number of devices


### Adaptive Learning


Continuously learn from new data and past incidents


## Challenges


---


### Data manipulation and AI powered attacks


Obtain the training data, change it to introduce biases


### Attack on AI systems


Specifically target AI systems by feeding malicious input


### Data Unavailability


Low quality and less amount of data


### Privacy concerns


## AI Application


---


### Chatbots

- AI powered conversation agents that use NLP, Transformer based models
- Chatbots like ChatGPT are trained on vast datasets using deep learning and transformer architecture
- Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) is an additional layer of training

Limitation:

- Example: Stack Overflow administrators have decided to place ban against any user who post answers generated from ChatGPT
- Like most/all machine learning models requires lot of computing power
